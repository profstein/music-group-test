        <h2>Page Ready Checklist</h2>
        <p>Here are things to check to make sure your page is ready</p>
        <ul>
            <li>BASE HTML: Do you have the base HTML elements? You can get these by typing ! and then tab and Emmet will write them for you.</li>
            <li>EXTERNAL CSS: Do you have a link element that points to yo
            <li>THREE PAGE SECTIONS: Do you have three page sections: header, main, footer? Remember that header and footer should be repeated on each page.
                <ul>
                    <li>Header: this should have your site title and navigation if you are using a traditional site navigation. You can set this up once and then copy/paste it across all of your pages.</li>
                    <li>Main: this element contains the page-specific content. Usually this is where your page title (h1 element) goes and then all of the page content for that page.</li>
                    <li>Footer: This is the information that is shared at the bottom of the page. I could contain things like copyright information. &copy; Your Name</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Page title: Do you have a page title in an h1 element?</li>
            <li>Paragraph: do you have at least one paragraph of text in a p element?</li>
            <li>Link: do you have at least one link in an a element? Your navigation counts for this.</li>
            <li>Image: do you have at least one imaage. Did you attribute your image? See image example below.</li>
        </ul>
